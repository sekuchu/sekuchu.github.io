# sekuchu.github.io

This repository powers my personal portfolio hosted with GitHub Pages. It contains the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets used to showcase my work, experience, and contact information.

## Local development

To explore the site locally, clone the repository and serve it with any static file server. One simple option is Python's built-in HTTP server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Structure

- `index.html` – the main single-page portfolio experience.
- `assets/css/` – styles for the site.
- `assets/js/` – JavaScript for interactive components such as navigation and filtering.
- `assets/images/` – profile pictures, project thumbnails, and icons.
- `backup/` – snapshots of the original files before the current redesign.
